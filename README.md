theWeatherNode
===============

Just another weather forecast webapp for practice jQuery, Handlebars and Node + Express.

Installation and execution instructions:
------------------------------------------
Installation:

    $ npm install

Execution:

    $ node app

Note:
-----

I have built a stand-alone version of the Webapp (without Node.js). Just HTML, CSS & Javascript (and JSON-P).
This is the [repo](https://github.com/babytruckdriver/foxyWeather).
